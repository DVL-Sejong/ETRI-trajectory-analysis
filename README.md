# Research area
Vehicle trajectory prediction and classification technology affecting traffic congestion

### Conversion-to-trajectory
Develop the process of mapping GPS, VD, and CCTV data to mapping and converting them into trajectories

### Trajectory-prediction
Develop the process of learning GPS trajectories and predicting them with deep learning models

### Congestion
Development of a process to show the impact of road congestion

### Visualization
Development of a technology that emphasizes trajectory visualization and congestion information using edge bundling technology and visualizes other traffic information together

### Visual-Analysis-System
Development of a visual analysis system that supports decision making through user interaction
